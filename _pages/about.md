# Yue Wang (汪越)	
* I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Informatics and the Center for Innovative Design and Analysis at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. I am also a member of the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine.
* I am a biostatistician focusing on developing statistical/computational methods for integrating multi-omics data to address important biomedical questions. Current projects mainly involve multi-view human microbiome data. 
* Prior to joining CU Anschutz, I was an assistant professor at Arizona State University. 
I worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Washington with [Prof. Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/interestedashojaie/index.html) and at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center with [Prof. Jing Ma](http://drjingma.com).
I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Tim Randolph's lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/randolph/en/research-overview.html) at Fred Hutch. I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 



# Recent News

* Sep, 2025. I am excited to start working on a [new NIH R35 MIRA grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bDsxBmlkt0ynP2rKSpkWAQ/project-details/11199416) titled **Robust Multivariate Methods for Analyzing Pathway Interactions and Pathway-Phenotype Associations in Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-seq Studies**.
* Sep, 2025. I just published [a review paper in WIREs Computational Statistics on dimensionality reduction](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/wics.70045) for structured biomedical data — check it out!
* July, 2025. Our [CoMMiT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24013v1) is online! CoMMiT is a novel within-cohort transfer-learning method designed to minimize negative transfer in microbiome studies. Check it out! 
* June, 2025. I received an [NIH R03 award](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/o3oxvKytF0uutS0MFflE6w/project-details/11121534) to study microbiome-metabolome interactions in IBD populations. 
* Apr, 2025. We propose [microbial correlation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05450v1) to study microbial co-metabolism. 
* Jan, 2025. We have a new paper accepted by Statistica Sinica! [RAPLS](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/ss_newpaper/SS-2023-0418_na.pdf) is an extension of partial least squares to generalized functional linear models. 
* Nov, 2024. We have a new paper accepted by Bioinformatics! This is joint work with Ph.D. student Ruoqian Liu and Prof. Dan Cheng from ASU. [Micro-DeMix](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae667/7905136?searchresult=1) is the first method to investigate the spatial compositions of fecal microbiomes.
* Aug, 2024. Our [highcor](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxae027/7725024?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=biostatistics&utm_medium=email) paper is online! 
* July, 2024. We have a new paper accepted by Biostatistics! This is joint work with Ph.D. student Haoran Shi. Check out this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07809) and our R package [highcor](https://github.com/taryue/highcor). 
* Feb, 2024. We have proposed an integrative framework to elucidate microbiome-metabolome-disease pathways. Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08222).
* Jan, 2024. We have developed smoothing spline methods to model the temporal dynamics of single-cell RNA-seq data. Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15309.pdf).
