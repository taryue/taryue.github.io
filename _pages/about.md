# Yue Wang (汪越)	
* I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Informatics and the Center for Innovative Design and Analysis at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. I am also a member of the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine.
* I am a biostatistician focusing on developing statistical/computational methods for integrating multi-omics data to address important biomedical questions. Current projects mainly involve multi-view human microbiome data. 
* Prior to joining CU Anschutz, I was an assistant professor at Arizona State University. 
I worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Washington with [Prof. Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/interestedashojaie/index.html) and at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center with [Prof. Jing Ma](http://drjingma.com).
I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Tim Randolph's lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/randolph/en/research-overview.html) at Fred Hutch. I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 



# Recent News

* Aug, 2024. Our [highcor](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxae027/7725024?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=biostatistics&utm_medium=email) paper is online! 
* July, 2024. We have a new paper accepted by Biostatistics! This is joint work with Ph.D. student Haoran Shi. Check out this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07809) and our R package [highcor](https://github.com/taryue/highcor). 
* Feb, 2024. We have proposed an integrative framework to elucidate microbiome-metabolome-disease pathways. Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08222).
* Jan, 2024. We have developed smoothing spline methods to model the temporal dynamics of single-cell RNA-seq data. Check out our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15309.pdf). 
* Dec, 2023. Fecal specimens are frequently used as proxies for gut microbiota, which is heterogeneous along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In our new [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571369v1), we developed a mixture model to investigate the compositions of fecal microbiomes.
