# About Me
* I am a statistician focusing on developing statistical learning methods for analyzing massive biological data to address cutting edge biological, clinical and public health related problems. Such biological data include neuroimaging data, multi-omics data and single cell data. 	
* I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at Arizona State University. Prior to joining ASU, 
I worked as a senior fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington with [Prof. Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/interestedashojaie/index.html) and [Prof. Jing Ma](http://drjingma.com).
	I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Tim Randolph's lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/randolph/en/research-overview.html) at Fred Hutch. I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics at UNC Chapel Hill in 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Hongtu Zhu](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/hongtu-zhu-phd/) and [Prof. Joseph G. Ibrahim](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/joseph-g-ibrahim-phd/).
